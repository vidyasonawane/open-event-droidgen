The Open Event Android project consists of two components. The **App Generator** is a web application that is hosted on a server and generates an event Android app from a zip with JSON and binary files ([examples here](http://github.com/fossasia/open-event)) or through an API. The second component we are developing in the project is a generic **Android app** - the output of the app generator. The mobile app can be installed on any Android device for browsing information about the event. Updates can be made automatically through API endpoint connections from an online source (e.g. server), which needs to defined in the provided event zip with the JSON files. The Android app has a standard configuration file, that sets the details of the app (e.g. color scheme, the logo of an event, link to JSON app data).

## 1. Android App

This is a generic app that has two parts:

A) A standard configuration file, that sets the details of the app (e.g. color scheme, the logo of an event, link to JSON app data). A sample of the JSON format is maintained in the [Open Event Repository](http://github.com/fossasia/open-event).

B) A JSON API provided by open-event-orga-servers server (Code maintained [here](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-server)).

### Sample App

A sample app for testing purposes is automatically built after commits in the repository. Please download and test the app that is using the code from the [dev branch here](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-droidgen/raw/apk/sample-apk-development.apk) and the code from the [master branch here](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-droidgen/raw/apk/sample-apk-master.apk).

### Android App Development Set up

Please find info about the set up of the Android app in your development environment [here](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-droidgen/blob/development/docs/android-app-setup.md).

### Data retrieval

- The orga-server provides the data which is stored in its backend database in a JSON format.
- The app on startup picks up data from a JSON file in its assets folder if the version number of data is -1, which happens when there is no internet connection
- If there is a valid internet connection, the data download starts from the server.
- Also, there is a check on the version of data already there in the app's database. If data is stale then only it is downloaded.
- If the database is empty then firstly JSON file in assets is accessed but if the internet is available, latest data is downloaded.
